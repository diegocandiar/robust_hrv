Matlab functions to compute cardiac sympathetic and parasympathetic indices, based on the Poincaré plot.

compute_CSI_CVI.m: Computes CSI and CVI (or CPI), adapted for humans (refs [1], [2])

compute_CSI_CVI_rat.m: Computes CSI and CVI (or CPI), adapted for rats (it changes the sampling frequency to 20 Hz)  (ref [3])

compute_PWVD.m: Computes a time-resolved LF and HF  

compute_SOPP.m: Computes second-order Poincaré plot measures  (ref [4])

compute_rCSI_rCVI_type.m: Computes CSI and CVI (or CPI), adapted for humans. It has the option to change the method (refs [1], [2])

robustCovHRV.m: Function necessary to compute the Robust approach.  (refs [1], [2])
